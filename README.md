##Compilation Instructions (Linux):
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Java Development Kit installed, and added to your PATH variable. Search Google if you don't know how to do that.
2. In a terminal, type javac, just to make sure you have it installed.
3. Run ```generate.sh```. You only have to do this once.
  * You can run ```clean.sh``` to remove the build directory with all compiled code.
4. ```cd``` into the ```build``` directory.
5. Run ```build.sh``` to compile the code. Make sure the path to javac is in your environment path variable.
6. Run ```run.sh``` to run the game!
